# Simulate CAS glass

In this practice, we will simulate a more complex glass system and learn a better method to submit your simulation tasks in Hoffman2, much better than lammps.q command.

Before we get start, please
- Download all LAMMPS files from [here](../5-Practice/LAMMPS_hoffman2) **Download entire folder and do not change the folder name**
- Download all input files from [here](../5-Practice/3-CAS_551035_simu) 
- For each section below, read carefully the introduction and ask your mentor to know whether you need to spend time on pracicing that specific task. 


## Create your initial .dat file for your simulation
TODO

## Use PACKMOL to generate initial simulation .dat file
TODO

## Set up LAMMPS and understand the submission script
(This is for everyone.)
Read this [file](../2-LAMMPS_and_MD/Set_up_LAMMPS_and_understand_the_submission_script.md) carefully to learn basic knowledge about submission script. 

## Submit your job using qsub and script
(This is for everyone.)
Follow the instructions in this [file](../2-LAMMPS_and_MD/Submit_your_job_using_qsub_and_script.md) to learn how to start a simulation using qsub.

## Compute the stiffness of simulated glass

## Analyze atomic structure of your simulated glass
